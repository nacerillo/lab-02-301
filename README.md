**base.css** Is used for all the css we want on every single page that we know will stay constant, it is only for high level things
**layout.css** is used to position elements on the page
**modules.css** deals with how things should look
**theme.css** deal with how things should look in a certain situation or when we want a temporary change. ie like a retailer with a sales site, or xmas site
